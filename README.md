plugin.audio.streamthecbc
=========================

A plugin to allow playing all CBC Radio streams through XBMC/Kodi

Play radio channels from CBC Radio (this is the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's English language service — this plugin makes no attempt to find Radio Canada's French language streams).</description>

"CBC™" is a trademark of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and is used solely to identify the source of the streams. This plugin has no official connection to CBC and is for personal, non-commercial, use only as permitted by CBC at http://www.cbc.ca/aboutcbc/discover/termsofuse.html (Section 2c).
							  
Note that most streams will not be available outside Canada. Radio 1 streams and the Radio 2 "International" streams should be usable.
